# Description

This is an assistant for the web game
[Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). This isn't meant to boost
scores or anything, it's just to see how good I can make automated guessing
through a combination of heuristics.

# Todos

- Weight previous Wordle solutions lower
- Add weightings for 2-letter combinations ("oi", "ns", etc)
- Maybe make some sort of UI or something
